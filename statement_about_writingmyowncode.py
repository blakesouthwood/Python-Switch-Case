about copilot.

I didn't use copilot to write any of my code.
I haven't used copilot yet.
I did get help making a few small behaviors from Stack Overflow
that I mention in my code.

So I wanted to make it clear that 99.9% of the code
that I wrote I did actually write myself.

Also I am starting a new project conquering the No Silver Bullet
proposed by Fred Brooks based on Dijkstra's Computer Assited
Programming paper and Dijkstra's Turing Lecture paper and
Don Knuth's Literate Programming paper.

Working on a quick and dirty prototype now in my spare time
when I'm not studying for my tests to get into teaching.
