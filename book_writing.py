I never thought any of this was possible. My whole 
view of reality is forever changed. Nothing seems real now.
I hunger for music to tune out reality and create my own
reality so I don't have time to think about what is going on.

But first how it began. I visited the Hollister Horse Ranch
in the autumn of 2017 after a facebook post by my friend
Marilyn's sister Terry who said why not come visit and
I did - later I was offered a job of caring for the horses
for room and board which ended up being for 2 years.  What
she neglected to mention was back breaking yard work and 
landscaping and shoveling manure. 

I was working on a horse ranch in Hollister taking care of
a dozen horses feeding, watering, and graining them and
felt like I was being held in a Death Camp in Nazi Germany
with Nurse Ratchet/Hilter for a landlord. I put up with
all of this nonsence to get free rent and use of a F350 pickup
that got 7 miles per gallon that I could use to work at
Walmart in Gilroy.

In my mind Hollister was bigger than the state of Texas. It was
a seven mile hike to Starbucks which I took on my days off.
I only discovered the County Express Shuttle after several months
of the long walk that would take me two hours. The reason that
I was going to Starbucks was so that I could code and use fast
wi-fi. I wanted to get away from the horses and flies and the
general nothingness of the five acre ranch that felt like a
prision camp to me. I was soon watching movies that refelected
what I was enduring: The Great Escape, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest, and  The Shawshank Redemption. I hungered for freedom. 

I was so desperate to leave that I studied hard and took the
Florida Teacher Certification Exam and passed it on the first
attempt and even flew to Tampa, Florida to be interviewed but
it was pretty scary there and so I resolved I better stay
in California where my friends were. What kept me going was
working on my Python coding. My dream was to get a programming
job so that I could leave the hell ranch in Hollister.

When I arrived  in April 2018 at the Horse Ranche after an overnight
train ride from Salem, Oregon where I spent the past year writing
JavaScript and applying for jobs without success. I intially 
immediately got a job as a stocker at Target in Hollister but it
only offered at most 16 hours per week which was unstastainable.

I had noticed the article in the New York Times about the Navy 
Tic Tac encounter near the USS Enteprise south of San Diego 
in 2004.I thought wow cool ufos without zero thought whatsoever
about the aliens. And I started watching the New York Post
Youtube channel called the Basement Files and each time it seemed
like there was scant evidence. 

So other than watching the movie Paul which I first saw in Oregon
and I walked out of the living room because I was convinced it
was just too far fetched I really had no interest in the matter.
I had enjoyed the Star Wars movies in terms of science fiction
but I was not an active reader of sci-fi novels.
