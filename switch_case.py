#C and C++ and JavaScript have switch case
# and now Python has it(sort of) easier on the eyes
# then bland if elif else
# it looks nice especially in Atom and Sublime

# it's also legal and possible to use continue instead of a break
# and change the case value after the triggered case value but
# before and above using a continue do this: case = "newvalue"
